# trux

Trux is a wrapper around Latex for writing reports more easily.  Latex produces beautiful output, but I find it awkward to use and hard to debug so I wrote Trux to make it really easy to create Latex reports.  The main difference from convert-markdown-to-Latex tools, like Pandoc is that Trux has a new, easier way to write mathematics.
